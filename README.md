### **Project Title**: Collaborative Social Media Platform for Professionals (GitHub + Google Drive Hybrid)

### **Project Overview**:
This project aims to create a unique online platform that merges functionalities of GitHub and Google Drive. It allows professionals, particularly artists and creators, to collaborate, share data, and announce their work. The focus is on seamless data management and social interaction tailored for creative professionals.

### **Objective**:
To design and develop a web-based platform that supports:
1. **Collaborative Data Sharing**: Enabling users to upload, share, and manage data, similar to Google Drive.
2. **Version Control and Collaboration**: Allowing users to work collaboratively with file version control, akin to GitHub.
3. **Professional Networking**: Facilitating artists' and creators' interactions with features for posts, announcements, and portfolio sharing.

### **Target Audience**:
Artists, creators, and professionals who seek a space to share their work, collaborate on projects, and announce important updates to their professional community.

### **Features & Modules**:

#### 1. **User Authentication and Profiles**
   - **Registration/Login**: Email-based authentication or single sign-on (SSO) through Google/LinkedIn.
   - **Profile Management**: Users can create profiles with portfolios, project highlights, and skills.

#### 2. **Data Storage & File Management** (Google Drive-like Functionality)
   - **File Upload/Download**: Users can upload various file types (images, videos, docs, etc.).
   - **Folder Structuring**: Create and organize files in folders.
   - **File Sharing Options**: Public, private, or team access controls.
   - **Real-time Sync and Access**: Files sync instantly across users who have permissions.

#### 3. **Version Control** (GitHub-like Functionality)
   - **Collaborative Editing**: Multiple users can edit files with access to version histories.
   - **Version Tracking**: Automatically saves previous versions of documents.
   - **File Comparison and Merge**: Shows differences between versions and allows merging.
   - **Commenting and Annotations**: Users can leave comments on files or specific parts of a file.

#### 4. **Social Networking & Collaboration**
   - **Activity Feed**: Users can post updates, project progress, and announcements.
   - **Followers & Connections**: Option to follow other users or make connections.
   - **Comments and Likes**: Users can engage with others' posts through likes and comments.
   - **Announcements**: Dedicated section for professional announcements like exhibitions, project launches, etc.

#### 5. **Search and Filtering**
   - **Advanced Search**: Users can search for people, files, and announcements.
   - **Filters**: Filter by file type, date, tags, or collaborators.

#### 6. **Notification System**
   - Real-time notifications for comments, version updates, shared files, and announcements.

#### 7. **Admin Dashboard**
   - **User and Content Management**: Admins can view user data, monitor shared content, and manage reports.
   - **Content Moderation**: Ability to remove inappropriate or flagged content.

### **Technical Requirements**:

#### **Frontend**
- **Tech Stack**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js (or another frontend framework like Vue.js).
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures usability on both desktop and mobile.

#### **Backend**
- **Server-Side Framework**: Node.js with Express, Django, or Flask.
- **Database**: MongoDB or PostgreSQL for user and file metadata storage.
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth for secure, scalable authentication.

#### **Cloud Storage & Version Control**
- **Cloud Storage**: Use AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob for storing files.
- **Version Control**: Implement a custom versioning system or use Git for file management on the backend.

#### **APIs & Integrations**
- **File Sharing API**: REST API for file upload, sharing, and permission handling.
- **Notification System**: Real-time notification API using WebSockets.
- **OAuth**: Integrate Google/LinkedIn for SSO.
- **WebSockets or Firebase** for real-time file collaboration.

### **Prototype Flow**:
1. **User Registration** → Create a Profile → Explore Profiles and Make Connections.
2. **Upload Files** → Organize in Folders → Set Permissions.
3. **Collaborative Editing** → Version Control & Commenting → Share and Publish Changes.
4. **Activity Feed** → Post Announcements, Like, Comment, and Engage.
5. **Admin Panel** → Monitor and Moderate Content, Manage Users.

### **Challenges and Solutions**:
- **Challenge**: Handling large files and ensuring real-time collaboration.
   - **Solution**: Use efficient cloud storage solutions and optimize WebSocket connections for minimal latency.
- **Challenge**: Version control complexity with large media files.
   - **Solution**: Limit version tracking for media files or implement differential saves to reduce storage use.

### **Project Timeline** (3 Months):
1. **Month 1**: Finalize project requirements, set up cloud storage, and begin frontend development.
2. **Month 2**: Build backend services for file management, version control, and real-time collaboration.
3. **Month 3**: Implement social features, integrate real-time notifications, and finalize testing and debugging.

### **Expected Outcome**:
A web platform that bridges the gap between file collaboration and social networking for artists and creators, allowing them to showcase their work, collaborate with peers, and engage with a professional audience.
